Description:
This GitHub Repository contains the code to run an evaluation of our study. This consists of the ARI robot administering the CAM-ICU feature 2 (Inattention) and feature 3 (Disorganized Thinking) using a BCI headset for option selection (Yes or No). 
The BCI headset also recorded the User facial expression data for CAM-ICU feature 3 (Altered Levels of Consciousness), CAM-ICU responses and time taken for task completion.


Dependencies:
The BCI headset uses the Emotiv Cortex API and adapts some of the code for the purpose of this study. 
This Repository also uses the ROSLIB API for connection the ARI robot and the AJAX API and Flask for requests to the researchers' device.
